I'm as small as an ant, as big as a whale. 
I'll approach like a breeze but can come like a gale. 
By some, I get hit, but all have shown fear. 
I'll dance to the music, though I can't hear. 
Of names, I have many, of names I have one. 
I'm as slow as a snail, but from me, you can't run. 
What am I?

A shadow.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some try to hide, some try to cheat, but time will show, we always will meet. 
Try as you might, to guess my name, I promise you'll know, when you I do claim. 
Who am I?

Death.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. 
I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. 
Who am I?

Malodux.
