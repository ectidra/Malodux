	You wake up from a nightmare with a searing pain in your chest.

	You quickly realise that you are not at home, but instead you are in an endless desert,
	sand as far as the eye can see. You look around, your body almost can't keep up with the speed 
	of your head. You start panicking, trying to find an explanation for your situation, but for some 
	reason you can't recall last night at all. You look further back, but you can't seem to remember 
	anything at all. Your name, your family, your home. It's all blank.

	Eventually you try to stand up, but your legs are weak, they can barely keep you standing.
	You feel something in your right hand, you look over and see a long stick, the perfect length
	to support you standing up. You must have missed it earlier when your head was spinning. 

	Over in the distance you see a sandstorm, rapidly travelling in your direction. You look around 
	for shelter and to your surprise, you find it. Behind you there is a tavern. Must have missed that 
	too. You quickly make your way over to it, hoping to take shelter from the sandstorm. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	You enter the tavern and see two people. One behind the counter and one sitting far in the corner, 
	facing the wall. Neither one seems to mind you breaking the glass. You walk to the counter and 
	start talking to the man behind the bar.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	You walk over to the man in the corner. He has not moved at all since you got here. As you get closer
	the low hanging lights start to flicker and you feel a shiver down your spine, moments later, a 
	chair is pushed out. You notice a knife laying on the table, out in the open. There is a red liquid 
	on it, which you can only assume is one thing. 

	As you sit down you see the mans face. He's full of scars, one much bigger than the others, over his
	eye and down across his cheek. He has that same red liquid from the knife under his eyes, it looks
	like some sort of war paint. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Malodux looks at you.

	- You're lucky I like you, you're a funny guy. But this last game will prove if you're worthy
	  of keeping around.

	Malodux looks at the knife on the table. The lights start to flicker and your head starts spinning
	again. He looks over to the man behind the counter and shortly after, so do you. 

	- I saw you talking to that man over there earlier, he's an alright guy. But that doesn't matter
	  since he failed my final game. 

	You look back to your table when you hear something shaking, it's the knife. You hear a loud high
	pitched noise burning your ears. Your vision blurs and you can't keep your head up. Then the noise
	stops. You look at the table and the knife is gone, you're worried you were stabbed so you rush to
	check your own body for any sign of a knife stabbing you, but you can't find anything. You look at
	Malodux, who is still looking at the man behind the counter, and now so are you. The man behind the
	counter has now become the man om the floor, surrounded by a puddle of blood, the same thing that 
	was on the knife, which is now sticking out of his chest. 

	You start freaking out, you stand up from your chair and back away towards the exit. Your breath has
	gotten faster and your heartbeats feel like someone punching you in the chest. The light start to 
	flicker, and the ringing is back.

	- I think I'll keep you around for now.

	But before you get a chance to answer, you feel something in your chest, something running down your 
	torso and legs. You look down and you see the knife, 5 seconds ago it was in the man on the floor,
	and now it's not, Malodux didn't even move a muscle yet somehow the knife is sticking out of your 
	chest. 

	Your vision slowly starts fading away, everything turns black. The high pitched noise is gone now.
	You hear nothing, everyting is silent. You close your eyes as you fall to the ground. Maybe you
	should have stayed outside, waited for the sandstorm to get you...

	You wake up from a nightmare with a searing pain in your chest...
